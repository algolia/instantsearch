React InstantSearch provides the necessary API entries to allow you to synchronize its state with the browser
url for example. The props you need to use are available on the [`<InstantSearch>`](guide/<InstantSearch>.html) component:

* `onSearchStateChange(nextSearchState)`: Function called every time the search state is updated.
* `searchState`: Inject a search state, turns the [`<InstantSearch>`](guide/<InstantSearch>.html) component into a [controlled component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).
* `createURL(searchState)`: Function used by every widget generating links and passed down to every connector. You
need to return a string.

[Read the example](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/tree/v2/packages/react-instantsearch/examples/react-router) linking React InstantSearch to [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

**Notes:**
* The [search state guide](guide/Search_state.html) details all widgets and connectors search state values.
* React InstantSearch can be plugged into any history or routing library, you only have to listen for searchState
changes and inject searchState appropriately.
