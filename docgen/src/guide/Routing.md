`react-instantsearch` does not automatically synchronise the search state with the URL. But you can do it
by using the state features exposed as props by the `<InstantSearch>` component:

* onStateChange(nextState): Function called every time the search state is updated.
* state: Inject a search state, turns the `<InstantSearch>` component into a [controlled component](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).
* createURL(state): Function used by every widget generating links and passed down to every connector. You
need to return a string.

[Read the example](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/tree/v2/packages/react-instantsearch/examples/react-router) linking `react-instantsearch` to [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

**Notes:**
* The [state guide](/guide/State.html) details all widgets and connectors state values.
* `react-instantsearch` can be plugged into any history or routing library, you only have to listen for state
changes and inject state appropriately.
