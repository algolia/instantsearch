You can build an autocomplete menu with React InstantSearch that uses an external autocomplete component. It takes advantage of the [`connectAutoComplete`](connectors/connectAutoComplete.html) connector.

[Read the examples](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/tree/master/examples/autocomplete)
showing you how to build an autocomplete menu that will let you:

* display hits from different indices
* have a textarea able to propose suggestions like mentions.

Those examples use advanced concepts from React InstantSearch. If you're not familiar with
them you can read their guide first:

* [Connectors](guide/Connectors.html)
* [Multi Index](guide/Multi_index.html)
