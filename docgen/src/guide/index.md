React InstantSearch is the ultimate toolbox for creating instant search experiences using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

Algolia is a hosted Search API. React InstantSearch is built on top of it to make it easy to integrate of Algolia into your React applications.

This means you need to have an account on Algolia in order to use React InstantSearch. Signup with
your GitHub account at https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up, there's a 14 days trial.

This guide walks you through the different concepts around React InstantSearch in a progressive way, from
essentials to advanced topics. If you have 15 minutes to kill, we also have a [Getting started tutorial](/Getting_started.html) for you to try.
