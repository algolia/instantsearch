React InstantSearch is the ultimate toolbox for creating instant search experiences using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

Algolia is a hosted Search API. React InstantSearch is built on top of it to make it easy to integrate of Algolia into your React applications.

You will need an Algolia account to use React InstantSearch. If you don't already have one, sign up using GitHub at https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up. New accounts are automatically enrolled in an unlimited 14-day trial. At the end of the trial you can upgrade to a paid plan or choose the Hacker Plan, which is completely free and lets you store up to 10,000 records.

This guide walks you through the different concepts around React InstantSearch in a progressive way, from
essentials to advanced topics. If you have 15 minutes, we also have a [Getting started tutorial](/Getting_started.html) for you to try.
