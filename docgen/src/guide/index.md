React InstantSearch is the ultimate toolbox for creating instant-search experiences using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

Algolia is a hosted Search API. React InstantSearch is built on top of it to make it easy to integrate of Algolia into your React applications.

You will need an Algolia account to use React InstantSearch. If you don't already have one, sign up using GitHub, Google, or email at https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up. New accounts are automatically enrolled in an unlimited 14-day trial. At the end of the trial you can upgrade to a paid plan or choose the Hacker Plan, which is completely free and lets you store up to 10,000 records.

This guide will teach you the concepts around React InstantSearch in a progressive way, from
essentials to advanced topics. If you'd rather jump right in with some code, see the [Getting started tutorial](./Getting_started.html) instead.
