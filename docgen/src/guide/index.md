`react-instantsearch` is the ultimate toolbox for creating instant search experience using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/).

Algolia is a hosted Search API. `react-instantsearch` is built on top of it to provides ease of integration of Algolia in your React applications.
