# react-instantsearch-core

React InstantSearch Core is an open-source UI library for React that lets you quickly build a search interface in your front-end application.

InstantSearchâ€™s goal is to help you implement awesome search experiences as smoothly as possible by providing a [complete search ecosystem](https://algolia.com/doc/guides/getting-started/how-algolia-works/#the-full-ecosystem). InstantSearch tackles an important part of this vast goal by providing front-end primitives that you can assemble into unique search interfaces.

> Note: `react-instantsearch-core` exports renderless components and hooks which can be used for both web and React Native. If you are using React in a web project, we recommend using the package `react-instantsearch` instead, as it includes complete components that render to the DOM.

## Installation

React InstantSearch Core is available on the npm registry. It relies on [`algoliasearch`](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-javascript) to communicate with Algolia APIs.

```sh
yarn add algoliasearch react-instantsearch-core
# or
npm install algoliasearch react-instantsearch-core
```
