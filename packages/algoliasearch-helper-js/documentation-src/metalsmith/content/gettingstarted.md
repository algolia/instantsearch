title: Getting started with the helper
---

## Before we start

The Helper has been made to create search-based applications. It will
help you structure the search of your app with a rock solid
foundation, and enhance it with advanced search features. Compared
to the JS client, the Helper is focused on providing search only
features, and provides an higher level API which will give you an
easy access to advanced search filters.

This **getting started** will show you how to:

 - integrate the helper in a webpage
 - build a complete search-as-you-type experience without a JS framework
 - use advanced Algolia filtering
 - build the according UI

The getting started will use jQuery for the sake of simplicity. However,
the Helper is agnostic and can also be used with other frameworks or
libraries.

In order to follow this tutorial you need to have access to an Algolia index.
The easiest way to follow this tutorial is by using the provided
credentials, using our ecommerce dataset. You can also adapt it to
your own dataset.

 > In order to use the full power of Algolia in the most efficient manner
 > we have created [InstantSearch.js](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/v2/) and
 > [react-instantsearch](https://community.algolia.com/react-instantsearch/) to
 > quickly build search UIs.

### Using the provided dataset

For the purpose of this tutorial, we'll use our ecommerce dataset. For further
reference, here are the credentials that we're going to use:

 - `applicationID`: `latency`
 - `apiKey`: `249078a3d4337a8231f1665ec5a44966`
 - `indexName`: `bestbuy`

[Let's get started](#integrate)

### Using your dataset

You need an [Algolia account](https://www.algolia.com/users/sign_up). You also need
to [upload a dataset](https://www.algolia.com/doc/indexing/import-synchronize-data/javascript#importing-data)
and your [search credentials](https://www.algolia.com/api-keys). Here are
the elements you need for the rest of the tutorial:

 - the application ID (referred later as `applicationID`)
 - the search API key (referred later as `apiKey`)
 - the index name (referred later as `indexName`)

You can still use the [provided Algolia index](#using-the-provided-dataset),
if you prefer. Otherwise, let's proceed with the setup of the library
in the application.

## Integrate

The helper is available on different platforms. You can use it as a script or npm. As the helper extends the client, we need to import both of them.

### Script tag

Using scripts, you can import the helper directly in your webpage. You will also need to import the [Algolia JS client](https://github.com/algolia/algoliasearch-client-js). To import the libraries, add those lines in your page:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/algoliasearch@3/dist/algoliasearchLite.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/algoliasearch-helper@{{pkg.version}}/dist/algoliasearch.helper.min.js"></script>
```

### npm

In an npm project, include the project with this command:

`npm install --save algoliasearch algoliasearch-helper`

You can also use Yarn:

`yarn add algoliasearch algoliasearch-helper`

## First search

The first step toward searching in your index is to initialize the client and provide it to the helper factory.

```javascript
/* if you use npm, you also need to add the correct requirements
var algoliasearch = require('algoliasearch');
var algoliasearchHelper = require('algoliasearch-helper');
*/
var client = algoliasearch(applicationID, apiKey);
var helper = algoliasearchHelper(client, indexName);
```

Once you've added those lines, you need to listen to the results coming from Algolia.
For now, we'll implement a very basic display of the JSON response in the page.

```javascript
helper.on('result', function(event) {
  renderHits(event.results);
});

function renderHits(content) {
  $('#container').html(JSON.stringify(content, null, 2));
}
```

At this point, we have no results yet. It's because we didn't trigger any search.
For now, we will do an *empty search* on your index. This will return the results
ordered according to the [custom ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/relevance/ranking#custom-ranking). Let's see how to trigger the search:

```javascript
helper.search();
```

The `search` method of the helper triggers the search with the current parameters
saved in the helper. For the moment we have none, therefore the results contains
the first records ordered by the [custom ranking](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/relevance/ranking#custom-ranking).

 - how to **instantiate** the helper
 - **listen** to the `result` event and **read the results** from Algolia
 - **trigger a search** to algolia

</div>

## Setting the query

The empty search is a great tool to display the first step of a search but it
is not what our users are looking for. They want to search in your data. Let's
see how to add a search input to let our users do a textual search in the data.

Before going further, let's customize a little bit the display of our results.
We're going to focus on the actual results computed by Algolia. The
results are returned in the `hits` attribute of the `results`. Let's display
only the `name` of each product for now.

```javascript
helper.on('result', function(event) {
  renderHits(event.results);
});

function renderHits(content) {
  $('#container').html(function() {
    return $.map(content.hits, function(hit) {
      return '<li>' + hit.name + '</li>';
    });
  });
}
```

Now that we have filtered the information displayed, let's add our search input:

```html
<input type="text" autocomplete="off" id="search-box"/>
```

And now let's listen to the changes to this input, so that we can update the query
and trigger a new search.

```javascript
$('#search-box').on('keyup', function() {
  helper.setQuery($(this).val())
        .search();
});
```

When calling `setQuery`, we change the value of the query inside the helper.
But this does not trigger the search, we need to trigger it manually, that's
why we call `search` afterwards.

To help our users better understand the results, let's use the highlighted
results returned by Algolia. This way the users can easily understand why the
results match their query.

```javascript
helper.on('result', function(event) {
  renderHits(event.results);
});

function renderHits(content) {
  $('#container').html(function() {
    return $.map(content.hits, function(hit) {
      return '<li>' + hit._highlightResult.name.value + '</li>';
    });
  });
}
```

The object `_highlightResult` contains all the attributes that may be highlighted
(by default, all the searchable attributes).

## Adding facets

A facet is a filter that can be used to restrict the results to specific values
of an attribute. For example, in our records we have an attribute `type`, with
a facet we can restrict the results to only `movie`. This way the results returned
by Algolia will only be those for which the attribute `type` has `movie` as a value.

If you're using your own data in this tutorial, you must add the attributes you
want to facet in the [display configuration of your index](https://www.algolia.com/explorer#?tab=display).
By the way, we also have a complete documentation
[on this subject](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/search/filtering-faceting#faceting).

First we should declare that we want to use the attribute `type` as a facet. This is done
during the initialization of the helper.

```javascript
var helper = algoliasearchHelper(client, indexName, {
  facets: ['type']
});
```

The list of available facets is returned by the Algolia API. This list is dynamic
and should be updated at each new results. So that's why we render this list each
time we receive new results. This list also lets our user select a value, so we should
also make it so that it's possible using jQuery.

```javascript
$('#facet-list').on('click', 'input[type=checkbox]', function(e) {
  var facetValue = $(this).data('facet');
  helper.toggleFacetRefinement('type', facetValue)
        .search();
});

function renderFacetList(content) {
  $('#facet-list').html(function() {
    return $.map(content.getFacetValues('type'), function(facet) {
      var checkbox = $('<input type=checkbox>')
        .data('facet', facet.name)
        .attr('id', 'fl-' + facet.name);
      if(facet.isRefined) checkbox.attr('checked', 'checked');
      var label = $('<label>').html(facet.name + ' (' + facet.count + ')')
                              .attr('for', 'fl-' + facet.name);
      return $('<li>').append(checkbox).append(label);
    });
  });
}
```

The method [getFacetValues](reference.html#SearchResults#getFacetValues) returns the list of values usable to filter
an attribute. The object returned by this method contains three properties:

 - `name`: the value of the facet
 - `count`: the number of items in the whole results
 - `isRefined`: is this value already selected

Let's add the rendering of the facet list into the `result` handler.

```javascript
helper.on('result', function(event) {
  renderFacetList(event.results);
  renderHits(event.results);
});
```

We now have a menu displaying the values that the user can choose from
to filter the list of results. Those values are generated by Algolia
based on the rest of the search, meaning that it will only provide facet
values that are meaningful for the current other parameters. Try typing
*apple* and the filter item *movie* will be removed.

This kind of facets are called *conjunctive facets* but they are not the only
kind of filtering that you can apply with the helper. You can also do:

 - disjunctive faceting (for making multiple choices filters)
 - hierarchical faceting (for making hierarchical navigations)
 - numerical filtering
 - tag filtering

## Going further

Congratulations! You now know the basics of the Helper. You should,
by now, have a better overview of the kind of features available in the
Helper, as well as the mechanics involved.

Here are some pointers on where to go next:

 - [the instantsearch tutorial](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/js/), for a more in-depth UI/UX oriented tutorial
 - [the reference documentation](reference.html), to see the whole possibilities of the Helper API
 - [the examples](examples.html), to see how to implement common patterns using the Helper
 - [the concepts](concepts.html), for a more high level presentation of the Helper API

Last but not least, the Helper is an intermediate API on top of the client
and it doesn't solve the UI complexity on its own. If you're looking for
a more off-the-shelf solution, we created [instantsearch.js](https://community.algolia.com/instantsearch.js/)
which reuses the helper internally.
