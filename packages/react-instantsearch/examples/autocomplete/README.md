This example shows how to use an external autocomplete component with `react-instantsearch`
It uses [react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest) as the autocomplete external component.

You will find two use cases:

* How to build an autocomplete displaying hits and facet values from the same index.
* How to build an autocomplete displaying hits from different indices

To start the example:

```sh
yarn
yarn start
```
