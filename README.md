# Project structure

- `/(root, you are here):` This is the main entry point of instantsearch.js where we build, develop, test and document all the instantsearch flavors.
- `packages/`: actually published npm packages
- `packages/react-instantsearch`: Set of React Components for instantsearch (In development)
- `packages/instantsearch`: `react-instantsearch` wrapped as a vanilla library with string templating abilities for ease of use in non framework situations (no React, no Angular) (Not yet started)
- `docgen/`: documentation website

# Development

We use our documentation website as the main way to develop instantsearch.js.

We recommend using [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to install
your development environment.

```sh
yarn
npm start
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000>.

# Test

We have unit tests for all `packages/`:

```sh
npm test # one shot run, also lint
```

```sh
npm run dev # watch mode, no lint
```

# Lint

```sh
npm run lint # only changed files in dev, all files in CI
npm run lint:fix
```

# Release

```sh
npm run release
```

# Update docs

```sh
npm run docs:update
```
