[![React InstantSearch logo][readme-logo]][react-doc]

First of all, thanks for wanting to help out with InstantSearch :tada:!

Here's some information you can use to contribute to InstantSearch

Currently we support [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
and plain JavaScript (or Vanilla) via:
- ‚öõ React and React Native ‚û°Ô∏è [React InstantSearch][react-doc]
- üç¶ Vanilla ‚û°Ô∏è [InstantSearch.js][vanilla-doc]

## Development

We use the [documentation website][react-doc] as the main way to develop
React InstantSearch.

```sh
yarn boot
yarn start
```

Go to <http://localhost:3000>.

## Test

We have unit tests for all `packages/`:

```sh
yarn test # one shot run, also lint and tries to build the documentation
```

```sh
yarn dev # unit tests watch mode, no lint
```

## Lint

```sh
yarn lint # only changed files in dev, all files in CI
yarn lint:fix
```

## Release

```sh
npm run release
```

This cannot yet be moved to `yarn release` so please use `npm run release`.

## Update docs

```sh
yarn docs:deploy-production
```

## Deploy a preview of docs

```sh
yarn docs:deploy-preview
```

This uses [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

## Upgrade deps

```sh
yarn upgrade-deps
```

## See next release changelog

```sh
yarn changelog
```
