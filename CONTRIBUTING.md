Hello and welcome to the contributing guide for InstantSearch.js. Thanks for considering participating in our project ðŸ™‡

If this guide does not contain what you are looking for and thus prevents you from contributing, don't hesitate to leave a message on the [community forum](https://discourse.algolia.com/) or to [open an issue](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/issues).

## Reporting an issue

Opening an issue is very effective way to contribute because many users might also be impacted. We'll make sure to fix it quickly if it's technically feasible and doesn't have important side effects for other users.

Before reporting an issue, first check that there is not an already open issue for the same topic using the [issues page](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/issues). Don't hesitate to thumb up an issue that corresponds to the problem you have.

Another element that will help us go faster at solving the issue is to provide a reproducible test case. We often recommend to [use this CodeSandbox template](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/algolia/instantsearch-templates/tree/master/src/InstantSearch.js).

## The code contribution process

InstantSearch.js was first developed in JavaScript and is now being migrated to TypeScript.

For any code contribution, you need to:

- Fork and clone the project
- Create a new branch for what you want to solve (fix/_issue-number_, feat/_name-of-the-feature_)
- Make your changes
- Open a pull request

Depending on what you're working on, you might consider different [base branches](#branch-organization).

Then:

- Peer review of the pull request (by at least one of the core contributors)
- Automatic checks ([tests](#tests), [commits](#commit-conventions), [linters](#linting))
- When everything is green, your contribution is merged ðŸš€

After you create a pull request, a bot will comment with a link to a development version of the website.

You will find a playground for the widgets, for example: https://deploy-preview-3376--instantsearchjs.netlify.com/stories/

## Commit conventions

This project follows the [conventional changelog](https://conventionalcommits.org/) approach. This means that all commit messages should be formatted using the following scheme:

```
type(scope): description
```

In most cases, we use the following types:

- `fix`: for any resolution of an issue (identified or not)
- `feat`: for any new feature
- `refactor`: for any code change that neither adds a feature nor fixes an issue
- `docs`: for any documentation change or addition
- `chore`: for anything that is not related to the library itself (doc, tooling)

Even though the scope is optional, we try to fill it in as it helps us better understand the impact of a change. We either use the name of the widget/connector/component impacted or we use impact topic (e.g. `docs`, `tooling`, `deps`, `ci`).

Finally, if your work is based on an issue on GitHub, please add in the body of the commit message "fix #1234" if it solves the issue #1234 (read "[Closing issues using keywords](https://help.github.com/en/articles/closing-issues-using-keywords)").

Some examples of valid commit messages (used as first lines):

> - fix(searchbox): increase magnifying glass size
> - chore(deps): update dependency rollup-plugin-babel to v3.0.7
> - fix(connectRefinementList): set default value for limit
> - chore: reword contributions guides

## Branch organization

The project is based on the classic GitHub flow:

- `master` for the current version being worked on â€“ Pull requests for bugs and feature related to the current major version should be created against this branch
- `vX` for each major version (`X` being a number) â€“ Pull requests for critical bug fixes should be created against this branch

Most of the time, your pull requests should target the `master` branch.

_Note that no new features will be developed or backported for the `vX` branches._

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:

- Node.js â‰¥ 8 (current stable version) â€“ [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#install-script) is recommended
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com)

## Launch the dev environment

We use [Storybook](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook) to create stories for widgets.

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

Go to <http://localhost:6006> for the widget playground.

## Folders of the project

Here are the main files and folders of the project.

```
â–¸ .storybook/         << the storybook configuration source
â–¸ scripts/            << the scripts for maintaining the project
â–¸ src/                << the source of the library
â–¸ stories/            << the widget stories
â–¸ website/            << the website source
  CHANGELOG.md        << the autogenerated changelog (based on commits)
  CONTRIBUTING.md     << this file
  package.json        << the definition of the project
  README.md           << the introduction of the project
```

### The source folder

```
â–¸ src/
  â–¸ components/       << The Preact components for the UI of our widgets
  â–¸ connectors/       << The source of all the connectors driving the widgets' logic
  â–¸ helpers/          << The source of the method helpers
  â–¸ lib/              << The core of the library (InstantSearch, routers, etc.)
  â–¸ types/            << The TypeScript declarations
  â–¸ widgets/          << The source of the widgets
```

## Tests

### Unit tests

Our unit tests are written with [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/):

To run all the tests once:

```sh
yarn test
```

To run the test continuously based on what you changed (useful when developing or debugging):

```sh
yarn test --watch
```

## Linting

Linters are static checkers for code. They help us maintain a consistent code base. They are used for JavaScript and TypeScript files.

If your editor support them, then you will see the errors directly there. You can also run them using your command line:

```sh
yarn lint
```

JavaScript and TypeScript files are validated using a combination of [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) (strict syntax form) and [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) rules (for common mistakes and patterns).

## Release

### Main version

To release a stable version, go on `master` (`git checkout master`) and use:

```sh
yarn run release:prepare
```

It will create a pull request for the next release. When it's reviewed, approved and merged, then CircleCI will automatically publish it to npm.

### Maintenance versions

For the maintenance versions, go to a previous version branch (e.g., `git checkout v3`) and use:

```sh
npm run release:maintenance
```

_Make sure to use `npm run` instead of `yarn run` to avoid issues._

#### `next` version

`next` version release is available on the `next` branch. It is used to release the next major version in beta.

```sh
git checkout next
yarn run release:prepare
```

The script will ask you a question about the next version. If it's wrong, you can say "No" and specify the version (e.g. "7.0.0-beta.0"). Then, it will open a pull request for that release. When the pull request is merged, CircleCI will publish it to npm with a `--tag beta` argument.
