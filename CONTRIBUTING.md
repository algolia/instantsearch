# Where to start?

Have a fix or a new feature? [Search for corresponding issues](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/issues) first then create a new one.

Always check the status of the [develop branch](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/tree/develop) for the freshest code.

Always submit pull requests to the develop branch.

**Wanna help us?** All issues belonging to the [`next` milestone](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/milestones/next) can be worked on.

# New API proposal

If you have a new **API proposal** or change, create an issue describing it precisely:
- JavaScript API example
- Resulting DOM/effect

Here's an example: [New widget: hitsPerPageSelector (#331)](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js/issues/331).

# How to write issues

Start with some context, when and/or where you encountered the issue.

Since instantsearch.js is a UI library, if your issue is UI related then adding a screenshot or (better) a GIF will make your issue a lot easier to understand.

# Development workflow

Requirements:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
- [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
- [Bundler](http://bundler.io/)

Run the local example:

```sh
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:8080
# make changes in your widgets, or in example/app.js
```

Run local example and docs:

```sh
npm run dev:docs
# open http://localhost:4000/
```

Run tests and lint:

```sh
npm test
```

# Serving the build

For some use cases like building a demo, you may want to serve the current build
on an http endpoint.

To do so:

```sh
npm run serve
```

Will build, watch for changes and serve instantsearch.css and instantsearch.js on http://localhost:8080.

# Commit message guidelines

We use [conventional changelog](https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog) to generate our changelog from our git commit messages.

**Some examples**:
- feat(rangeSlider): add new range option to the rangeSlider
- fix(refinementList): send the full algolia result to the noResults template

Here are the rules to write commit messages, they are the same than [angular/angular.js](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/7c792f4cc99515ac27ed317e0e35e40940b3a400/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format).

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**.  The header has a special
format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```text
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

The **header** is mandatory and the **scope** of the header is optional.

Any line of the commit message cannot be longer 100 characters! This allows the message to be easier
to read on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

## Revert
If the commit reverts a previous commit, it should begin with `revert: `, followed by the header of the reverted commit. In the body it should say: `This reverts commit <hash>.`, where the hash is the SHA of the commit being reverted.

## Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing
  semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation
  generation

## Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example `RefinementList`,
`refinementList`, `rangeSlider`, `CI`, `url`, `build` etc...

## Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

## Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes".
The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

## Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to
reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.

**Breaking Changes** should start with the word `BREAKING CHANGE:` with a space or two newlines. The rest of the commit message is then used for this.

# Squash your commits

Once you are done with a fix or feature and the review was done, [squash](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/10/squashing-commits-with-rebase.html) your commits to avoid things like "fix dangling comma in bro.js", "fix after review".

The goal is to have meaningful, feature based commits instead of a lot of small commits.

Example:
    - `feat(widget): new feature blabla..`
    - `refactor new feature blablabla...`
    - `fix after review ...`
  - **both commits should be squashed* in a single commit: `feat(widget) ..`

# When are issues closed?

Once the a fix is done, having the fix in the `develop` branch is not sufficient, it needs to be part of a release for us to close the issue.

So that you never ask yourself "Is this released?".

Instead of closing the issue, we will add a ` âœ” to be released` label.

# Milestones

- `next` => Ideas, questions, refactors, bugs that were discuseed, turned into clear actions by the maintainers. You can work on this.
- `x.x.x` => selected `next` actions to be done in a release. You can work on this.
- no milestone => Still need investigation / discussion

# Releasing

If you are a maintainer, you can release.

We use [semver](http://semver-ftw.org/).

This task will merge develop into master.

# Hotfixes

All our work is done on the develop branch but it could be necessary to push a hotfix to the master
branch and do a patch release. To fix a very important bug.

For this, you should:
- add `HOTFIX` to the commit message **body**
- submit your pull request to the master branch

## Releasing hotfixes

You must be on the master branch.

```sh
HOTFIX=1 npm run release
```

## Documentation updates

If you have important documentation update to release without wanting to release
a new version of instantsearch.js, you can do a documentation hotfix.

Then once the hotfix is merged into master, the documentation will be updated automatically.
