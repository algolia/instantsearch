**Instantsearch.js** is an opensource project developed and maintained by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com) [on github](https://github.com/algolia/instantsearch.js) and released under MIT license. Our mission has always been to help developers implements a great search in no time. We started by focusing our efforts on the speed and relevance of the search engine itself and we quickly discovered that it was important to request our engine directly from the frontend: end-users want that Google or Amazon experience: a relevant and fast search results page that doesn't require a page reload.

We dedicated all our energy on developing a product that could be used directly from the frontend, without compromising all the required security features. For example our [secured API Keys](https://www.algolia.com/doc/ruby#secured-api-keys) allows us to replicate all the restriction enforcements you were used to do in your backend by a frontend implementation. Unfortunately, we also discovered that the implementation of the UI itself is complex and time consuming. It sounds easy at first, but there is a lot of details that makes it tricky; like handling of refinement states, updating the URL, etc...

We started the development of **instantsearch.js** in early 2015. Our initial idea was inspired by [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/checkout), a great payment UI/UX packaged as a JS library that anyone can easily use. The main difference between Stripe Checkout and **instantsearch.js** is that it is close to impossible to package one UI/UX for all search use-cases. This is why we have preferred to take a different approach and develop a UI library that contains different widgets that you can assemble, customize and extend to build a great search experience.
