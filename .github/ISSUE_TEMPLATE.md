**Do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?**

<!--
  ***************************
  If the current behavior is a bug, please provide all the steps to reproduce and a minimal
  [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io/) example or a repository on GitHub that we can `npm install`
  and `npm start`.

  We have a simple online template for you to use as a base to explain your bug or issue:
  https://codesandbox.io/s/github/algolia/instantsearch-templates/tree/master/src/InstantSearch.js

  If you are requesting a new feature, we need to understand WHY would you
  need this feature (your use case) or how you are limited with the current API.
